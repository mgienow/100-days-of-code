# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018
##### Creaking into motion

**Today's Progress**: Got started on this 100DOC effort, studied some YDKJS Kyle Simpson and read some online blog posts about JS skills a junior web dev needs to know

**Thoughts:** Simply getting this repo set up is sort of a win. I'm very tired and not thinking clearly. Tried to start off with a codewars challenge and could not engage my brain. I've been away from JS mindset for close to a month and the gears were grinding. But I know steady practice each day will create real progress.

**Link to work:** all in my head!! for now
