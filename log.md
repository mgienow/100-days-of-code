# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018
##### Creaking into motion

**Today's Progress**: Got started on this 100DOC effort, studied some YDKJS Kyle Simpson and read some online blog posts about JS skills a junior web dev needs to know

**Thoughts:** Simply getting this repo set up is sort of a win. I'm very tired and not thinking clearly. Tried to start off with a codewars challenge and could not engage my brain. I've been away from JS mindset for close to a month and the gears were grinding. But I know steady practice each day will create real progress.

**Link to work:** all in my head!! for now

###Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ninety-plus minutes reviewing -- and coding ahead of the instructions, woo hoo! -- Practical JavaScript in preparation for jumping into the professional track at watchandcode.com

**Thoughts:** Although I was mostly able to stay ahead of the step-by-step how to in PJS, I definitely needed the first step outlined as a prompt to get me going and headed in the right direction. Humbled by a briefly baffling glitch which I realized quickly enough was because I had incorrect object syntax inside a method. I should know this stuff by now, and delivered the appropriate amount of self-castigation. At the same time, I did catch it pretty quick, so there's that. Focus on progress, on how far I have come, and not on the times I stumble: that is the challenge.

###Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Versions 4 & 5 of WatchandCode Practical JavaScript

**Thoughts** Felt significantly more fluent with the code today. Able to press ahead even when it felt overwhelming; if i took a minute -- or several minutes -- to think things through, I could figure it out without relying on being led through it. Still feeling rusty, but proud and more confident. Also it finally occurred to me that I should start a repo for the different iterations of the app as it progresses.

###Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Version 6 of PJS. Also researched/read about/understood difference between APIs and Webhooks.

**Thoughts** Still making small syntax errors but catching them quickly. However, tried to refactor to make use of map() or forEach() and was not able to get either to work in a reasonable amount of time, and decided to focus on building the app as is instead of figuring out now where I"m going wrong.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018

When I did this last year, I started doing a codewars kata each day. It really made me feel like a coder. Now I am really struggling to figure out JS code challenges, though I feel like I know so much more ABOUT the language, have so much more understanding.

**Today's Progress** flailed around with codewars kata "Title Case" -- got the logic to solve, or most of it, but not quite there on getting code to run.

**Thoughts** my struggle is in how to handle UNDEFINED values. What do you do when a parameter simply isn't passed? As in, the second param in this function is optional.

##Day 6: January 6, 2018

I want major props for doing this while at MAGfest :)

**Today's Prgoress** got Title Case challenge to run, but only by brute force. There has got to be a more elegant way to solve. So my next challenge will be to find that way. Feeling good that it works, though!

##Day 7: January 7, 2018
**Today's Progress:** simply not quitting

**Thoughts** I've been feeling really frustrated with my inability to think through code challenges. I have lost a great deal of ground from 8 months ago when I was doing daily code challenges, and this is all my own fault. So a loop of self-blame and criticism. Not helpful! Last night I looked at an FCC challenge that Asa was struggling with, and realized that I had done it back in April of last year, and had zero idea now of how to approach it. I had to look at my own solution on GH to figure it out. This really dropped my spirits to the basement. I ended up doing some basic FCC JS tutorials to boost my confidence, and to feel like I am getting my head back in the game. It helped, knowing the answers and moving forward quickly. Also I re-learned some things I'd forgotten like string immutability. That you can't simply assign a new string to an existing string variable, but need to use string prototype methods to alter it.

##Day 8: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** PJS - a new section I hadn't done before, on the differences between primitives and objects in JS, how data type comparisons behave differently. It was very useful. There were quizzes to see if you were grasping the logic, and that really helped -- my takeaway is REMEMBER TO LOOK AT EACH VARIABLE AS ITS OWN VALUE. JS sees only the assignment. Even if two variables are clearly related, logically, JS does not care -- but our human brains step in with relational assumptions that the computer brain simply does not see.

Now moving on to V7 and it's my goal to complete this today.

**Update** Finished v7

##Day 9: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress** I must confess to getting a few days behind in the log. Worked through more PJS. The using the debugger section. Today was a trainwreck because schools closed almost as soon as they opened, and my entire workday was about 90 minutes.

##Day 10: 1/10/18

**Today's Progress** Continued working through the FCC basic JS track as review. No new concepts, but it's definitely helping bring the previous learning I've done to the surface for more easy accessibility when i do try to code. Also it is helping with my confidence. So I did about 90 minutes and am more than halfway through what is supposed to be a 10 hour track.

##Day 11 1/11/18

**Today's Progress**  More FCC basic JS.  Plan to finish that today and try to get back to PJS.
