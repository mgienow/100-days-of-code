# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018
##### Creaking into motion

**Today's Progress**: Got started on this 100DOC effort, studied some YDKJS Kyle Simpson and read some online blog posts about JS skills a junior web dev needs to know

**Thoughts:** Simply getting this repo set up is sort of a win. I'm very tired and not thinking clearly. Tried to start off with a codewars challenge and could not engage my brain. I've been away from JS mindset for close to a month and the gears were grinding. But I know steady practice each day will create real progress.

###Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ninety-plus minutes reviewing -- and coding ahead of the instructions, woo hoo! -- Practical JavaScript in preparation for jumping into the professional track at watchandcode.com

**Thoughts:** Although I was mostly able to stay ahead of the step-by-step how to in PJS, I definitely needed the first step outlined as a prompt to get me going and headed in the right direction. Humbled by a briefly baffling glitch which I realized quickly enough was because I had incorrect object syntax inside a method. I should know this stuff by now, and delivered the appropriate amount of self-castigation. At the same time, I did catch it pretty quick, so there's that. Focus on progress, on how far I have come, and not on the times I stumble: that is the challenge.

###Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Versions 4 & 5 of WatchandCode Practical JavaScript

**Thoughts** Felt significantly more fluent with the code today. Able to press ahead even when it felt overwhelming; if i took a minute -- or several minutes -- to think things through, I could figure it out without relying on being led through it. Still feeling rusty, but proud and more confident. Also it finally occurred to me that I should start a repo for the different iterations of the app as it progresses.

###Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Version 6 of PJS. Also researched/read about/understood difference between APIs and Webhooks.

**Thoughts** Still making small syntax errors but catching them quickly. However, tried to refactor to make use of map() or forEach() and was not able to get either to work in a reasonable amount of time, and decided to focus on building the app as is instead of figuring out now where I"m going wrong.
